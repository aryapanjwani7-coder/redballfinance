# Coal India (COALINDIA) — Why I bought

**Date:** 2025-08-10  
**Position size:** 100 @ ₹480

## Snapshot (TL;DR)
- **What it is:** India’s dominant coal miner supplying the majority of domestic thermal coal.
- **Why now:** Pricing discipline + volume visibility + dividend yield.
- **Risks:** Regulatory caps, renewables pace, cost inflation.
- **Horizon:** 2–4 years with dividends as buffer.

## The thesis
- Stable domestic demand from utilities; logistical improvements support volumes.
- Scale advantages and policy support underpin cash generation.
- Valuation implies limited growth—dividends drive most of the return.

## Watching
- FSA vs e-auction mix, realizations, capex execution, working capital.

## Position management
- Add on weakness if fundamentals intact; reconsider if e-auction premia collapse structurally.
