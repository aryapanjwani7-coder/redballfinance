# Coal India Ltd — Investment Report

> **TL;DR**
>
> - **Dominant moat:** ~**74%** of India’s coal output; state backing; capital-intensive + regulated industry keeps new entrants out.  
> - **Buyer power:** utilities have leverage; **e-auction premiums** fell **72% → 48%** in FY25, but long-term FSAs (~629 MTPA) anchor volumes.  
> - **Substitution risk rising** (policy target to cut coal’s share of power from **72% → 55%** by 2030), yet coal remains India’s baseload for the next decade+.  
> - **Compelling value:** around **7× P/E**, **ROE ~35–39%**, **ROCE ~48%**, **dividend ~6–7%**.  
> - **Cash machine:** OCF ₹**29,000 cr** (FY23) → **₹18,100 cr** (FY24) → **₹29,200 cr** (FY25). FY25 PAT **₹35,302 cr** (-6% YoY) with margins **29% → 28%** on lower auction premia and higher depreciation/contract mining costs.  
> - **Key drawbacks:** majority government ownership (incentives), limited high-growth runway, ESG/policy overhang.  
> - **Thesis:** high-quality cash generator to **park capital** with downside protection and steady income; big upside less likely than steady, solid returns.

## Moat: Porter’s Five Forces (FY 2024–25)

<details>
  <summary><strong>1) Threat of New Entrants — Very Low</strong></summary>

- CIL produced **~74%** of India’s coal in FY25.  
- Mining remains **capital-intensive**, tightly regulated, and reliant on **state-owned reserves (~389 Bt)**.  
- Despite commercial mining auctions, scale & infra requirements keep barriers high.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>2) Bargaining Power of Suppliers — Very Low</strong></summary>

- Reserves owned by the **Government of India**; allocated to CIL.  
- **310 mines**, in-house engineering (CMPDIL), and state backing reduce outside dependency.  
- **Wage costs** are large (220k+ employees), but state-mandated—doesn’t translate to classical supplier power.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>3) Bargaining Power of Buyers — Moderate to High</strong></summary>

- **Power sector** dominates demand: **661 MT** in FY25; CIL supplied **616 MT** (~**93%** materialisation).  
- Non-regulated sectors (steel, cement) sourced **145 MT**, with flexibility to **import**.  
- **E-auction premiums** fell **72% → 48%** in FY25, signalling reduced scarcity power.  
- FSAs (~**629 MTPA**) provide volume stability; large utilities (NTPC, state gencos) still wield negotiating leverage.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>4) Threat of Substitutes — Rising</strong></summary>

- Coal fuels **~72%** of India’s power today; policy roadmap targets **~55%** by 2030.  
- CIL is investing in **renewables** (installed **209 MW**, **9.5 GW** target by 2030).  
- Gasification/coal-to-chemicals diversify, but **renewables growing faster** than coal demand.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>5) Industry Rivalry — Low (Domestic), Moderate (Imports)</strong></summary>

- **Domestic:** CIL is unrivalled at ~**74%** share.  
- **Imports:** India relies on imported coking coal; some coastal plants prefer imported high-grade thermal coal.  
- Policy push for **import substitution** strengthens CIL but also introduces exposure to **global price swings**.

## Valuation & Profitability

- Purchase context: **~7× P/E** — suggests limited downside if earnings stay resilient.  
- **ROE ~35–39%**, **ROCE ~48%** → efficient asset use.  
- **Dividend yield ~6–7%**, supported by strong cash generation.  
- Cheap multiple reflects ESG/policy risk and the “sunset industry” overhang; still, returns on capital remain robust.

## Cash Flow & P&L

- **Operating cash flow (OCF):**  
  - **FY23:** ~**₹29,000 cr** — high e-auction premia + strong demand.  
  - **FY24:** ~**₹18,100 cr** — softer realizations + working-capital drag (“weak year”).  
  - **FY25:** ~**₹29,200 cr** — rebound confirms underlying cash power.  
- **Profitability:**  
  - **FY25 PAT:** **₹35,302 cr** (-6% YoY); margin **29% → 28%**.  
  - Drivers: lower auction premia; higher depreciation & contract-mining costs as projects capitalise — **growth-linked** costs, not structural weakness.  
- **Workforce:** down from ~**272,445** to **~229,000** (FY24); plans to reduce by **~5%/yr** over 5–10 yrs may partially offset wage inflation.  
- **Capex focus:** first-mile connectivity, land/equipment for new seams, coal gasification, thermal power JVs, and renewables — **offensive capex** aimed at throughput and diversification.

> _Idea for later:_ add a **cash-flow waterfall** (FY23 → FY25). I can generate it once you drop the line items (OCF bridge) in INR.

## Potential Drawbacks

- **State ownership**: incentives less aligned to minority shareholders; growth not top priority.  
- **Upside ceiling**: very high returns less likely vs. high-growth private peers; valuation may stay “cheap.”  
- **Policy/ESG**: renewables transition & regulations can weigh on multiples; reliance on government decisions persists.

## Bottom Line

Coal India remains a **dominant, cash-rich utility-style** producer with policy support and long runway as India’s baseload evolves. For a paper portfolio, it’s a **defensive cash generator** with income and limited downside; treat it as a **durable yield + modest compounding** story rather than a hyper-growth bet.
