# Kirloskar Brothers (KIRLOSBROS) — Why I bought

**Date:** 2025-08-15  
**Position size:** 40 @ ₹1650

## Snapshot (TL;DR)
- **What it is:** Leading pump maker with presence in water supply, irrigation, power, and industrial applications.
- **Why now:** Order book momentum tied to infra + exports; margin discipline improving.
- **Risks:** Project delays, input inflation, export softness.
- **Horizon:** 3–5 years.

## The thesis
- India infra (water, irrigation) spending supports multi-year demand.
- Product breadth + installed base = switching costs & service revenues.
- If margins hold and exports scale, earnings compounding follows.

## Watching
- Order intake, execution cycle, export mix/realizations, working capital.

## Position management
- Trim if margin slippage persists; re-check if order intake slows materially.
